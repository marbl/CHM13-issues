<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Issues Track: <ver.>_issues.bed<\p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
This file contains regions with low coverage support and locatoin of each error k-mer obtained from HiFi and ONT platforms.<br><br>

Reads were aligned with Winnowmap 2.01.<br><br>
Primary read alignments have been processed with asset commit ver. 0133f268eebf308a1c3eb356b564550526465157, and regions meeting the following criteria are reported in each platform:<br>

<li> Less than 7 reads aligned in hifi, 10 reads aligned in ONT<br>
<li> Merged when regions are less than 5 kb apart<br>
<li> Exclude low coverage at both 3 kb ends of each chromosome due to natural coverage drop<br>
<li> Exclude low coverage overlapping rDNA gaps<br><br>

Additionally, regions below were included:<br><br>
  
<li> Regions with base error were detected with 21-mers from Illumina-HiFi reads using Merqury
<li> Chimeric consensus of two haplotypes and collapsed simple tandem repeat, found from variant calling and other methods

</p>
<p>
Raw low coverage tracks from each platform (containing clippings and low coverage from sequencing biases):
<li> hifi.pri.issues.bed
<li> ont.pri.len1k_idy85.issues.bed
</p>
<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<!-- if there are special conventions, like colors, describe them here -->
<p>
<li> Error_Kmer (k-mers found only in the assembly, and not in the Illumina-HiFi hybrid set) : 0,0,0 (black)
<li> Chimeric_Hap (Joined two haplotypes) and Collapse : 204,0,0 (red)
<li> Low (Low coverage), Low_Qual (Low coverage associated with consensus error) : 204,0,0 (red)
