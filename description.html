<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Issues Track: v1.0_issues.bed (hifi.pri.issues.bed)<\p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
This file contains regions with low coverage from HiFi and ONT platforms.<br><br>

Reads were aligned with Winnowmap 2.01.<br><br>
Primary read alignments have been processed with asset commit ver. 0133f268eebf308a1c3eb356b564550526465157, and regions meeting the following criteria are reported in each platform:<br>

<li> Less than 7 reads aligned in hifi, 10 reads aligned in ONT<br>
<li> Merged when regions are less than 5 kb apart<br>
<li> Exclude low coverage at both 3 kb ends of each chromosome due to natural coverage drop<br>
<li> Exclude low coverage overlapping rDNA gaps
</p>
<p>
Issues track from each platform:
<li> hifi.pri.issues.bed
<li> ont.pri.len1k_idy85.issues.bed (this file contains regions completely overlapping hifi.pri.issues.bed)
</p>
<p>
Clipped regions not associated with low coverage:
<li> hifi.pri.clipped.bed
<li> ont.pri.len1k_idy85.clipped.bed
</p>
<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<!-- if there are special conventions, like colors, describe them here -->

<li> Low_GA/TC, Low_AT (Low coverage from sequencing bias) : 153,153,255 (light purple)
<li> Clipped (Region with excessive read clipping) : 153,153,153 (gray)
